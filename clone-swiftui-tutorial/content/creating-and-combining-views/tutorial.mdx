# !hero Creating and combining views

This tutorial guides you through building _Landmarks_ — an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details.

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses _stacks_ to combine and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view’s design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code.

Download the project files to begin building this project, and follow the steps below.

# !sections Create a new project and explore the canvas

## !intro

![!cover A screenshot of the editor and canvas, with the iPhone preview showing to the right.](01010H.png)

Create a new Xcode project that uses SwiftUI. Explore the canvas, previews, and the SwiftUI template code.

To preview and interact with views from the canvas in Xcode, and to use all the latest features described throughout the tutorials, ensure your Mac is running macOS Sonoma or later.

## !steps Step 1

Open Xcode and either click “Create New Project” in Xcode’s startup window, or choose File > New > Project.

![!screenshot A screenshot of the Xcode welcome screen. There are three options to choose from when you open Xcode: Create New Project, Clone Git Repository, and Open Existing Project. The first option is highlighted.](010101.png)

## !steps Step 2

In the template selector, select iOS as the platform, select the App template, and then click Next.

![!screenshot A screenshot of the template selector sheet in Xcode. In the top row, iOS is selected as the platform. In the Application section, App is selected as the template. The Next button in the lower-right corner is highlighted.](010102.png)

## !steps Step 3

Enter “Landmarks” as the product name, select “SwiftUI” for the interface and “Swift” for the language, and click Next. Choose a location to save the Landmarks project on your Mac.

![!screenshot A screenshot of the project sheet which shows the name Landmarks filled in for the Product Name. The interface is set to SwiftUI, and the language is set to Swift.](010103.png)

## !steps Step 4

In the Project navigator, select `LandmarksApp`.

---

An app that uses the SwiftUI app life cycle has a structure that conforms to the `App` protocol. The structure’s `body` property returns one or more scenes, which in turn provide content for display. The `@main` attribute identifies the app’s entry point.

```swift LandmarksApp.swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct LandmarksApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

## !steps Step 5

In the Project navigator, select `ContentView`.

---

By default, SwiftUI view files declare a structure and a preview. The structure conforms to the `View` protocol and describes the view’s content and layout. The preview declaration creates a preview for that view.

![!preview A screenshot from the Xcode preview as it would appear on iPhone, with the image of a globe and the text, Hello, world, centered in the middle of the display.](010105.png)

```swift ContentView.swift
import SwiftUI

// !Mark(1:11)
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

## !steps Step 6

The canvas displays a preview automatically.

---

If the canvas isn’t visible, select Editor > Canvas to show it.

![!screenshot A screenshot of the Xcode canvas showing an iPhone preview screen that has the text Hello world below a globe icon.](010106.png)

## !steps Step 7

Inside the body property, remove everything but the Text declaration and change “Hello, world!” to a greeting for yourself.

---

As you change the code in a view’s body property, the preview updates to reflect your changes.

![!preview A screenshot from the Xcode preview as it would appear on iPhone, with the text, Hello SwiftUI!, centered in the middle of the display.](010107.png)

```swift ContentView.swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        // !Mark
        Text("Hello SwiftUI!")
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

# !sections Customize the text view

## !intro

You can customize a view’s display by changing your code, or by using the inspector to discover what’s available and to help you write code.

As you build the Landmarks app, you can use any combination of editors: the source editor, the canvas, or the inspectors. Your code stays updated, regardless of which tool you use.

![!cover A screenshot of the editor and canvas, with the iPhone preview showing to the right.](01020H.png)

## /

Next, you’ll customize the text view using the inspector.

## !steps Step 1

Change the canvas mode to Selectable.

---

The canvas displays previews in Live mode by default so that you can interact with them, but you can use the Selectable mode to enable editing instead.

![!screenshot A screenshot of the editor and canvas, with the iPhone preview showing to the right.](010201.png)

## !steps Step 2

In the preview, Command-Control-click the greeting to bring up the structured editing popover, and choose “Show SwiftUI Inspector”.

---

The popover shows different attributes that you can customize, depending on the type of view you inspect.

![!screenshot A screenshot of the editor and canvas, with the iPhone preview showing to the right.](010202.png)

## !steps Step 3

Use the inspector to change the text to “Turtle Rock”, the name of the first landmark you’ll show in your app.

![!screenshot A screenshot.](010203.png)

## !steps Step 4

Change the Font modifier to “Title”.

---

This applies the system font to the text so that it responds correctly to the user’s preferred font sizes and settings.

![!screenshot A screenshot.](010204.png)

## /

To customize a SwiftUI view, you call methods called _modifiers_. Modifiers wrap a view to change its display or other properties. Each modifier returns a new view, so it’s common to chain multiple modifiers, stacked vertically.

## !steps Step 5

Edit the code by hand to add the `foregroundColor(.green)` modifier; this changes the text’s color to green.

![!preview A screenshot.](010205.png)

```swift ContentView.swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Turtle Rock")
            .font(.title)
            // !Mark
            .foregroundColor(.green)
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

## /

Your code is always the source of truth for the view. When you use the inspector to change or remove a modifier, Xcode updates your code immediately to match.

## !steps Step 6

This time, open the inspector by Control-clicking on the `Text` declaration in the code editor, and then choose “Show SwiftUI Inspector” from the popover. Click the Color pop-up menu and choose Inherited to change the text color to black again.

![!screenshot A screenshot.](010206.png)

## !steps Step 7

Notice that Xcode updates your code automatically to reflect the change, removing the `foregroundColor(.green)` modifier.

![!preview A screenshot.](010207.png)

```swift ContentView.swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Turtle Rock")
            .font(.title)
            // !Mark

    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

## !steps Step 8

Set the preview back to Live mode.

---

Working in Live mode makes it easy to keep track of view behavior as you make edits in source.

# !sections Combine views using stacks

## !intro

Beyond the title view you created in the previous section, you’ll add text views to contain details about the landmark, such as the name of the park and state it’s in.

When creating a SwiftUI view, you describe its content, layout, and behavior in the view’s `body` property; however, the `body` property only returns a single view. You can combine and embed multiple views in _stacks_, which group views together horizontally, vertically, or back-to-front.

In this section, you’ll use a vertical stack to place the title above a horizontal stack that contains details about the park.

## !steps A Game of Thrones

A Game of Thrones is the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin. Set in a world where seasons last for years, it introduces a complex plot and a wide cast of characters, ranging from noble families vying for the Iron Throne to the supernatural threats in the North.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",

const winner =
  houses[
    Math.floor(
      Math.random() * houses.length,
    )
  ]

console.log(`Iron Throne: ${winner}`)
```

## !steps A Clash of Kings

A Clash of Kings, the second book in the series, continues the epic saga. The Seven Kingdoms are plunged into war, with kings rising and falling. Meanwhile, Daenerys Targaryen seeks to return to Westeros with her growing dragons.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",

        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${traitor} betrays the alliance!`
}

console.log(reveal())
```

## !steps A Feast for Crows

A Feast for Crows, the fourth book, explores the aftermath of the wars, with a focus on the characters in the southern regions of Westeros. It delves into the politics and power struggles in a kingdom weary of battle.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Martell",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Tyrell",

      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  const ally2 =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${ally1} and ${ally2} form an alliance!`
}

console.log(intrigue())
```

## !steps A Dance with Dragons

A Dance with Dragons, the fifth book, runs concurrently with A Feast for Crows and focuses on the characters in the North and across the Narrow Sea. The story advances with dragons, the Night’s Watch, and the lingering threat of winter.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",
]

const dragons = () => {
  const dragon =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${dragon} has a dragon!`
}

console.log(dragons())
```

## !steps The Winds of Winter

The Winds of Winter, the anticipated sixth book, is expected to continue the intricate storylines and bring new twists and turns to the world of Westeros. Fans eagerly await its release.

const winterIsComing = () => {
  const isComing = Math.random() > 0.99
  if (isComing) {
    return "Winter is coming!"
  } else {
    return "Winter is not coming."
  }
}

console.log(winterIsComing())
```

## !steps A Dream of Spring
