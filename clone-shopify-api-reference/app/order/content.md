## !intro Order

An order is a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a shop. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete orders using the Order resource.

- When you create an order through the API, no payment information is collected, and no transaction is performed.
- After an order is created, you can change only a few of its attributes using the API. You can't change the items or the quantities in an order using the REST API, but you can change them using the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/order-editing).
- You can add [metafields](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/current/resources/metafield) to the Order resource.
- You can allow merchants to create orders manually by using the [DraftOrder resource](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/current/resources/draftorder).
